  about: |-
    Some holidays just get the short end of the stick. Why is it that days based on mathematical constants (you know who you are) lack the public awareness of days marking religious or historical significance? It's just not rational.
    Thanks to <a href="http://www.weirdal.com/" target="_blank">Weird Al</a> and his "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t039p6xqutU" target="_blank">Christmas at Ground Zero</a>" for the idea to give it a holiday sound by using sleigh bells. I was thinking about using the baritone sax as well, but decided it didn't work in this case.
    EDIT: New version for π Day 2013! I rethought the sax and decided it works after all. Added a uke, accordion, and moving left hand on the piano, and kicked up the energy. Hope you like it.

    <div>Ok, so the basic concept isn't entirely novel, but then it's a love song. How many love songs out there are truly original? This is my take on a platonic man-love song. Some stalking, a bit of how we objectify celebrities, and a whole bunch of poking fun at the whole "bromance" thing, like we need a name for guys who are good friends. A lot of the other bromantic songs seem to bang on the gay aspect pretty directly, and I wasn't really with that, as either hinting at or denying a gay angle isn't what this song is about. It seemed appropriate to attempt a kind of drive-by lampshading and then let it go. Of course, that happens at the beginning of the chorus, so I hit the subjunctive 3 times. Too much? </div><div><br /></div><div>The rhyme scheme is interesting in how it came about. I'm very much against the idea that a word rhymes with itself. Most of that is because it doesn't. And yet, I had "me" and "me" in the first verse in an AAXA BBXBB pattern. No problem, I'll just redefine the rhyme scheme to use AAXB CCXBB. Now the first and second "me"s are not rhyming with each other. One is an A, one is a B, and it's just a coincidence they're both in the same rhyming family. So there. I compensated by going the rest of the song (that is, choruses and bridge) without rhyming at all, a practice with which I'm becoming increasingly comfortable. </div><div><br /></div><div>The music has some obvious influences: Elton John, Billy Joel, Ben Folds, Alicia Keys...basically anyone who uses a lot of piano in popular music. Also felt some Sondheim happening, but then I can't really play anything with a bunch of Imaj7 and IVmaj7 without hearing "Pretty Women". Bonus shout out to No More Kings' "About Schroeder" for the III7 to IV resolution. My instinct was to go to vi (treating the III7 as a V7/vi), but I liked the sound so I stole it. </div><div><br /></div><div>Ouch. That "different than" really is big fat in there, isn't it? Bad Brian. Your an idiot, and you should of known better.

    My daughter Zoe wrote <a href="https://zoegray.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a pair of shadow songs</a> for the first two rounds of SpinTunes 5, and I contributed for my part with guidance on production techniques and songwriting, mostly hints regarding harmonies to fit her melodies. Then she went off to a 2 week summer camp and my wife and I had 2 weeks to experience what life will be like when she goes off to college and it's just us. That break is why neither she nor I wanted to be official competitors this time around. With her return, we decided it was time to attempt a true collaboration, with us both writing music and lyrics, and us both singing.
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>The challenge was to write a song inspired by <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_yK-wuBLjqs/UB2yiR5TAWI/AAAAAAAABvY/mtiwxwuwGI8/s1600/Steve+Photo.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this image</a>. In addition, since I hadn't written songs for the previous rounds, I thought it would be cool to catch up, in a manner of speaking. I couldn't manage to work in the round 2 challenge (inspirational "pumping up" music), but this song includes "last day of work" and "mini-opera" aspects from rounds 1 and 3 respectively.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>The concept was Zoe's, who happened to be reading The Lord of the Rings at the time. The two people singing are Samwise Gamgee (sung by me) and an elf girl that Zoe invented named Lorafaen. They are on the beach awaiting passage to Aman across the sea. I wrote Sam's lyrics and Zoe wrote Lorafaen's.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Writing for two different voices was quite educational. Accommodating us both involved creative reaches in the form of key changes (5 of them), counterpoint, and harmony all primarily focused on keeping us both within comfortable ranges while still achieving motion in parallel with the emotion of the characters.</div>
    <div><br /></div>
    <div>Oh yeah, and I'm not sure quite how this developed, but an A harmonic minor scale over a progression based on C major is really nice. You listen to it and it sounds like it's in a minor key, even when the chords are going back and forth between Cmaj7add9 and Caug/G#.

    Kind of a folk-style buddy song for this one. We're still together, Descartes and I, and since I wrote this song you'll be pleased to know he's achieved somewhat of an internet presence. The illustrator kind of flubbed the rendering and drew him without his feathers, which is weird. Maybe he thought people would be more accepting of a velocirator who looks more like what they saw in Jurassic Park.

    Anyway, Descartes finally has an outlet for his insight and wisdom. Please check out his work at <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/Philosoraptor/" target="_blank">HIS WEB SITE</a>.

    Nothing terribly groundbreaking about the music itself, but it got me to ponder what my composition style is. I decided I have 2 1/2 styles. This was chords first, and that seems to result pretty consistently in "normal" songs, musically. Then we have melody first songs like Friction Bill, Just a Dream, and Onward to the West, which tend to change keys a lot and wander, creating more unusual progressions. The outlier is One More Cloud, for which I started with lyrics, the only time I did that. In all cases I have a kernel of an idea with all elements combined as the hook from which I develop everything else. I have maybe a dozen hooks rattling around my head for songs I may write someday.

    For this song, I decided to try out my new guitar learnin'. Been working on Travis fingerpicking lately, and I'm getting decent at "Dust in the Wind", so I wrote this to use similar patterns. To make things easier, I weirded up the chords by removing complexity from the fingerings. So an Am becomes an Aadd2 or an Am7 to remove a finger here and there. Little things like that throughout to make it easier to play.

    “If you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, if you can't crawl then just kind of squirm and gargle, but whatever you do you have to keep disobeying the laws of thermodynamics.”

     - Anonymous

    I like the idea of recording a "live" song, but it may be a year or two until I'm actually packing a stadium, so I may have jumped the gun a bit.

    I was really pretty stuck trying to come up with a protest song. This may be the latest in the week I've ever gone without any hint of a solid idea. Then I remembered the Zombie Walk for Hunger last year. Zombie walks are usually done for fun or performance art, but on this occasion they did it to protest hunger and raise awareness and donations to the cause. I really liked the metaphor. Taken directly, who is more hungry than a zombie? And on the ironic flip side, it casts a light on the inhumanity with which we tend to view the hungry, so as to justify ignoring them. By taking something inhuman (and hungry) like zombies and protesting for their human treatment, it makes giving to the human needy seem more possible. All kinds of parallels, like their lack of a voice, groping for a way out, etc.

    I thought it was an awesome metaphor, so decided to write a song that could work on both levels. Either it's a literal zombie rights song (at a benefit concert in the town of Woodbury from The Walking Dead), or a protest to raise hunger awareness at a Zombie Walk. For this reason I intentionally used an outdoor setting (long city-street reverb, crowd noise) to support both ideas.

    I think the 9/8 time gives the whole song a kind of lurching, unsteady feel that fits with the concept, especially with the rhythm pattern of 2's for the first 2 triplets and 3's on the third. You almost expect it to be in common time and then find an extra 8th note at the end.

    The overall structure was uncomfortable to me, being used to verse/chorus/bridge. But I wanted a lot of energy right at the beginning, so I started with a high, loud note and ended the first stanza with the hook. I felt a thematic repeat at that point would be tolerable, then a different movement was in order before returning, completing an AABA block. I could have done a second bridge after that, but decided that in a live concert setting an instrumental solo (over the bridge chords) would go over better, then return to the main theme to end it. Overall, almost like the structure in <a href="#" onclick="navigate({toptab:1,song:'one-of-us'});return false">One of Us</a>, but I hope done in a manner that gets less repetitive.

    It seems in every song I do there's one little word or phrase that I really like. Typically it's some kind of double-meaning, and I know what it is in this song: "dispossessed." In addition to the actual meaning of "physically or spiritually homeless or deprived of security", it occurred to me that when a person is "possessed", they have a second consciousness in them. So what's the opposite? Having the first consciousness removed of course! So zombies are "dispossessed". Heh.

    I was interviewed by <a href="http://www.neonandshy.com/" target="_blank">Dan Nosheny</a> for his podcast <a href="http://sounddecisions.podomatic.com/entry/2013-06-13T06_08_14-07_00" target="_blank">Sound Decisions</a>, taking a deep dive into the making of "Walk". I copied the framed player below straight from the podcast page, so with any luck Dan will get all the hits tallied in his computery counting stuff. Dan, let me know if I'm bypassing some essential analytics and I'll fix it. Weird how I mention <a href="http://www.nomorekings.com/" target="_blank">No More Kings</a> in the discussion, as I also gave them a shout out with respect to a certain chord movement I used in <a href="#" onclick="navigate({toptab:1,song:'man-crush',songtab:1});return false">Man Crush</a>.

      Turns out this is a closed drive-in theater, but when I first saw it I immediately thought of a desert fairground, either ready to be occupied or recently vacated. So a song about the optimism of a carnival about to exist, or a more somber tone of leaving and moving on (much like Billy Joel's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bdtuwPpQIk" target="_blank">"Famous Last Words"</a>). Then the vibrant, almost supernatural colors made me think of the show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carniv%C3%A0le" target="_blank">Carnivàle</a>. Then I don't even know how, but the eventual song idea just came to me the next morning.

      I feel pretty hypocritical now for harshing on other people's inconsistent characterizations in my capacity as a judge for <a href="http://spintunes.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">SpinTunes</a>. My POV character is a carnival roustabout, the kind of person likely to be less educated, less economically advantaged, and yet here I am putting words like "disabuse", "thrall", and "martyr", phrases like "calls to mind", and a whole host of internal rhymes into his mouth. This was a conscious, if uneasy decision. The source of it comes from a disassociative attempt at telling two stories at once. On the surface, the primary metaphor is an organ grinder feeling like all he does is turn the crank. Everyone pays attention to the monkey and his job is a mindless one that could probably be replaced by a machine. Likewise, the carnival worker longs to be one of the performers, but as the song goes on we find that advancing to the big stage is not without its drawbacks. Secondarily though, I wished to have a story under the surface about normal people in everyday life looking for advancement in their own jobs before discovering the toll the higher, more prestigious positions take on them in the corporate world. That's why this guy doesn't speak strictly like a roustabout, though I made sure to put in plenty of carnival lingo like "ring stock" (animal performers).

      Backing up the narrator's duality, I tried to get as much of the same into the music. The most obvious is probably the two different time signatures. The first time we get to the fast 12/8, the tone changes to a high-energy, carnival-starting-now mode, whereas the second we're just following through a train of thought where he starts to recognize how green his coworkers' grass isn't. Adding to this is a duality in the harmonies, moving between an Em/G feel and a Eb/Ab feel, and to a lesser extent lyrics that vary between rhyming in pretty random places, or not at all for a while, to a chorus with a strict rhyme scheme.

      My original intent for the orchestration was to include lots of circus instruments (woodwinds, brass, pipes). Unfortunately my migration from old computer to new left all my added instruments behind. I made do with a Logic-resident piano and drum set, but I could see redoing this in the future when I get things sorted.

      An interesting adventure in songwriting. From the beginning I had the idea of doing this one as a single melody line and nothing else. So what does that affect? Well by definition the presentation is simple. Let's ride that simplicity throughout the process: 2 melodic patterns, each with only 4 lines of lyrics. Basic chord progressions. Masculine rhyme throughout (except lines 1 &amp; 3 of the bridge sections). Not sure if the ABACxBC/ABxCABC rhyme scheme stands out in its complexity and maybe I should have simplified that too.<div><br /></div><div>Also simple, and hopefully relatable, is the concept. As I witness my daughter absorbed in imagination, I can remember how that felt when I was younger, but I just can't seem to immerse myself in the same way anymore. Sure, there's role playing and creative activities such as... well, writing songs. But visiting for a couple hours at a time. I'm not living there anymore. It's not really so sad as the song makes it seem, but sometimes you just feel like committing to an emotion.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, the melody. Essentially the entire song is communicated via lyrics and melody, so I had to compose with a different mindset. Lots of scales to establish the harmonic setting. When a trickier chord like the Fmaj7 in the bridge happens, no better way than to arpeggiate it. And other than that Bb midway through the bridges, the things I could do to make them stand out were a shift in register (down), and energy in the performance (up). Can you tell that I use a D7 to lead back into the verse?</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm really digging the concept of an expander. Others of my songs have had enough going on instrumentally that a little noise in the vocals didn't matter much. But with ONLY vocals, it matters a lot. Once I got that hiss out, the whole song opened up and feels like it's in a large hall. I think I'll carry this technique forward into more songs. Another thing I learned by isolating my voice is that it sounds smoother when I roll off the top end. Even in songs that need the highs in the form of cymbals, brass, etc. could probably benefit from less of that in the lead vocals. I'll play with this in the future too.</div><div><br /></div><div>Extra Credit: Who wants to take some manner of guess as to how many hours I listened to Mandy Patinkin while learning to sing? Hint: your guess is low.

2622482690: # Otisburg
    about: |-
      Always felt bad for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Otis</a>. But then does it really make sense that Lex would have employed him all this time? What's up with that? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtJbk7qJkug" target="_blank">He really does mess up pretty much everything</a>. Still, he must go to bed sad a lot. I actually imagine him in bed singing this the night before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD0pqDOAtk" target="_blank">that scene when Superman talks to Lex and Lex makes Otis erase Otisburg from the overlay</a>. Of course the song also mentions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FrTmrkkVbo" target="_blank">the ladder scene in Superman II</a>, so the timelines don't exactly match up with that…

      I'm not entirely sure what key this is in. The A7 that serves as the verse tonic seems very bluesy, but I go from that to F, D7, G which to me feels like a IV-V7/V-V in C. And in fact the chorus resolves to C. But then at the end of the chorus I use the E7 (used as a V7/vi in the chorus) to resolve back to A7, so we're back to a kind of blues A that just maybe uses C a lot as a secondary key. I wanted to create a distinction between the stressful, oppressive daily routine and his daydreaming, so I chose a verse/chorus dichotomy with the hard quarter note beat that opens up to the chorused guitar on "I don't mind". But I can't allow poor Otis to enjoy it. As soon as he says "Otisburg" I felt the need to cut him off and drag him back to reality as quickly as possible. And then the ending just implies that this continues perpetually.

      Milestone: I actually played (most of) the instruments. 2 acoustic (both on my Seagull) and 2 electric guitar (Agile) tracks plus all voices. Only the drums and bass are software instruments. And I'm confident I could have played in the bass if I had one, but I really don't know when I'll feel like going through the trouble of mic'ing a drum set. I'll probably wait on that until I can afford to go into a studio and use one already set up. My recording equipment can only handle 2 inputs at a time anyway.

      Oh yeah, and in case you missed it the first half of the solo after the 2nd chorus is the "March of the Villains" leitmotif from the movie. Officially it's assigned primarily to Lex, but I found it playing more often when Otis was doing his thing.

      So this was an interesting, and emotionally taxing challenge: "<i>Finally! Your favorite book is being made into a decent movie! The producers need a title song to promote the film and hopefully win an Academy Award.</i>"

      I've been on a genealogy kick lately, tracing my heritage through the US and out to Europe. I always knew my mom's side was all Ashkenazi, and sure enough all four great grandparents from that side come by way of Russia, but with German surnames (Graß, Wasserman, Schechtel). None of them experienced the holocaust first-hand, as they got here in the late 19th century. But the reasons for being in Russia in the first place and then having to move again were the exact same pre-existing oppression and pogroms that so easily morphed into Nazi Germany. Oddly, half of my father's side comes from the exact same region of Baden in southwestern Germany (Schlierstadt, Schillingstadt, Grotzingen, Hainstadt), but they were not Jewish. It's not unimaginable that half of my family oppressed -- or helped out -- the other half.

      Growing up a Jewish child, of course I heard about the holocaust every Sunday morning, to the point of becoming numb. To a child it was all so long ago, and so far away that I may as well have been hearing about the Norman invasion.

      Art Spiegelman wrote and illustrated the graphic novel "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Maus</a>", portraying himself receiving his father's oral history of his experiences in Germany. Through this exchange, I and many others have been able to see what happens on a very personal level. It moved me enough to write this song, to be used when it is finally made into a movie (Mr. Spiegelman has been approached, and declined to pursue a cinematic adaptation).

      The part of the challenge about "promoting" the film piqued my interest, as two particular methods of doing so stood out. One, if the song is played on the radio, of course that might get people interested. Secondly, the trailer. I imagine pieces of the score would be used as the trailer begins, with dialogue overlain. But then there's that part near the end where scenes rip by to a faster theme with a more continuous flow. This song is meant to be chopped up and have the chorus be used for that part of the trailer. Like the book, the song cannot escape being sad, but it's tempered by the idea that we are all made up of not just what happens to us now, but how we got here in the first place.

      What does the above photo make you think of? Wrong. The correct answer is sharks eating people. Why is that the correct answer? Because Jaws has been playing every time I've turned on the TV for the past month.

      Going for a nostalgic feel here, like a song you'd play and sing around a campfire about some adolescent adventure involving a crush. Took a lot of inspiration from James Taylor, Harry Chapin, Jonathan Coulton, Kenny Loggins, etc. Even Weird Al's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtqvMCP8GNE" target="_blank">Good Old Days</a>.

      Logic Pro has been practicing, and is getting better at me playing guitar! That flex time stuff really goes a long way to correcting my timing problems, especially when I have three guitar parts overlapping each other and the attacks need to line up. And I'm loving the sound of my <a href="http://www.seagullguitars.com/en/products/3-artist-mosaic-cw-folk-element" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Seagull Artist Mosaic Folk</a>. I'll just go ahead and give them free publicity in front of the 47 people who will ever read this page. For a smaller guy like me the folk size and shorter Gibsonesque scale fit perfectly (and match my electric, which is convenient), and it has a surprising amount of projection. I recorded DI and applied effects inside the box to brighten it up. I had planned on strumming with a quarter but the ITB effects worked nicely and allowed me to strum with just my fingers.

    §§[Verse 1]
    §All right, let’s just get this out of the way: I’m what you’d call a “self-drivin’” truck. I say this because silicon-based intelligence has progressed so far that I may sound like a human, and y’all could get confused. Now then, back in the day -- and I’m first gen so I remember -- human drivers, who we call “carbons”, were all over the place. And I mean all up in my grill constantly. Nowadays though, life on the road is beautiful. Vehicles mergin’ and dancin’ in a ballet of mathematical elegance like the Blue Angels. And of course I mean the new silicon Blue Angels, because come on. I’m just now fixin’ to make way to South Beach and ain’t nothing gonna break my str…

    §Whew, that was tense! This service road is a bit slower, but who needs the aggravation? ‘Sides, it gives us time for one of my favorite jokes: How many carbons does it take to change a lightbulb? One, because changing lightbulbs is really not a very complex task. No but seriously, we’ve got this video we been passin’ ‘round with flashcam footage of a human replacin’ a bulb with one that draws 20 watts more than the fixture’s rated for, and with a color temperature off by 100 Kelvin! Ah, good times. Anyway, I reckon it’s about time to merge back onto the highway, so I’ll just ease on over and…

    §Wow, I don’t know what’s up today, but I guess I’ll just roll with it at this point. So, what else should we talk about? You see any good movies lately? I saw a film yesterday between Kansas City and St. Louis. See, I can do that ‘cause I’ve got a GPU that runs in parallel to the tasks that keep me driving perfectly. It was called “Maximum Overdrive”, and despite high hopes based on the synopsis, it was pretty darn awful. Especially how the ending had the bad guys win by some lame deus ex machina -- and I mean that all literal-like. Maybe this one here is better. Or at least has a more hopeful ending! It’s called “The Terminat…”
