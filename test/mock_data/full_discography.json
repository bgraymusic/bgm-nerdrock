                "about": "Music by Jonathan Coulton, lyrics by Brian Gray\r\n\r\nA companion piece to \"When You Get There\", I wrote this partly to ease my way into songwriting. It uses the music from Jonathan Coulton's \"I'm Your Moon\", and in fact, I ended up staying very close to the original orchestration. I intended to get the instruments in place, modeled after Coulton's piece, then one by one replace them with voice until the entire piece was rendered in contemporary a cappella style, complete with vocal percussion. I may still do that someday, but halfway through the effort I decided the version with instruments sounded better, so I put that on hold.\r\n\r\nAs for the song itself, the inspiration for its subject matter comes from a book my wife is currently writing, entitled \"Dream Girl\". Without giving too much away (not my plot to share), it renders dreams, prophesies, and loss on a canvas of adventure and horror, with appropriate touches of humor. I imagine this song playing over the closing credits of the movie made from the book.",

                "about": "The time has come once again for SpinTunes, and this time I'm entered as a contestant! The round 1 challenge was as follows:\r\n\r\nThere's No Place Like Home - Write a song about YOUR hometown.\r\n\r\nYou should use the name of the town in the song at some point. The town you pick can be your place of birth, where you grew up, or where you're living now; but it has to be someplace you have actually lived at some point in your life. If you once took a 2 week vacation to Florida...that does not count. We mean someplace you have roots of some sort.\r\n\r\nI've lived in South Bend, Indiana for the past three years now. It's a great place, nestled comfortably between \"small town\" and \"real city\". We get four seasons most years (seemed to skip Spring this time around), excellent family neighborhoods, and it's an easy drive or train ride to Chicago if we want to see a large-budget show or eat at a four-star restaurant.\r\n\r\nAs for the song, I expect the most frequently asked question will inevitably be \"what do you have against St. Louis?\" Perhaps I'll even get me an arch enemy out of the whole ordeal. The reality isn't so interesting. I actually think St. Louis is a beautiful place, and considered moving there at one point. Its two largest flaws are syllabic pattern and luck. To fit the song the way I wanted, I needed a city with three syllables, and the stress on the middle one. Candidate cities: Milwaukee, Miami, St. Louis, Toledo, Eureka, Ann Arbor. You may think of more, but my die has six sides so I stopped there. The roll came up \"3\", so St. Louis it is, despite that being by far the most difficult of the six to sing high.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of singing, this one was tough. Obviously influenced by \"We Are The World\", I took the composition job seriously and wrote for many diverse voices to sing it. That meant taking the pitch up and down quite a way to give a place for all voice types. As it turned out, the original melody exceeded my personal vocal range. It was well over 2 octaves all told, so in order to hit the higher harmonies, I couldn't get a good quality on the lowest notes. Given the options of recording up and transposing in software or changing the composition, I opted for the latter. I took the chorus down to a lower point, and transposed the whole piece up a minor third. It still clocks in at 2 octaves plus a half step, but I think it sounds better this way.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and first ever song produced entirely in Logic Pro! GarageBand has been good to me, but it's time to move on. Hope there are no bad feelings. For one thing, features aside Logic Pro is much easier on my bottom-of-the-line laptop processor. GB was complaining of lack of resources at 6-7 tracks. This song has 22 with all the vocal harmony and clapping and more layers of effects than I used to do. I also love the ability to bus primary tracks together to aux tracks, either via sends or output. I was able to balance all the drums individually with separate eq for the kick, an '80's-style gated reverb for the snare, and doubled hi-hat panned hard left and right, blend with the bass and claps, and adjust all that as one unit through my \"Rhythm Section\" aux channel. Really cool stuff.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have the nagging feeling that the melody that starts the choruses has been done before, but I can't place it. If anyone finds out I'm infringing on a prior work, please let me know and I'll change it. For some reason I'm thinking late '70's / early '80's ballad.",

                "about": "I never was happy about the recording and production quality of the original Staff Meeting. It was the first song I ever made, in the basement of my old house. It was a good song, and because of its status as the first one, always appears first on my web site. So new visitors click on the first entry and hear something recorded on a mic that came with a karaoke machine, in a concrete box, then mixed with a first stab at doing way too much and making it all tinny and harsh.\r\n\r\nSo recently on a vacation to Delaware, I decided it was finally time to recreate the song from scratch. It had to be from scratch, as my house was broken into a while back and all my source materials stolen, so all I had of my songs were (are) the bounces I posted on the web.\r\n\r\nWhat's up with that weird out-of-place orchestral part at the beginning, with the horns and timpani? Well I also have in mind a new musical I may or may not write one day, and this is how it will start. Imagine this entrance, but instead of cutting to the staccato guitar so soon, it falls into a slower theme and continues an overture that includes songs I haven't written yet (and a couple I have). Then finally we open on Staff Meeting, which sets the show in motion with a guy getting laid off from his programming job. I'll leave things there, so as not to give away too much info on something that may never exist.",

                "about": "This song is my first attempt to write under a strict deadline. I submitted it as a shadow entry to the SpinTunes competition, which prescribed a challenge to be completed in 8 days or less. Turns out I was done in 3, so that gives me confidence for future contest entries. First competition, round 3: \"Write a sad song about birth, a moment that is normally a happy moment, and make it a real tear jerker. You can't use the words 'Happy' or 'Birthday'.\" Well, as in my previous \"sad\" song, She Said, I seem to have a problem going full gloom. I tried to balance out the levity inherent in the subject matter with a healthy dose of depression.\r\n\r\nThere's tons of credit to go around for this one. First, my wife was immensely helpful during the brainstorming stage. Together, we worked out the subject matter during a 30-minute walk, where I likely would have spent a couple days figuring out what to write about. She also gave good perspective into places where my lyrics were too vague and cleared up the meaning. Musically, there's all kinds of influences here. Duran Duran, George Michael, Rob Thomas, Brian Setzer...I'm even pretty sure the melody in the verses was influenced by Jekyll & Hyde by Frank Wildhorn. I was pretty proud of the half-step modulation going into the chorus until I noticed it's just a IV/VI, transitioning from E minor to C major. Nothing to see here.\r\n\r\nPlease give some of your time and traffic to SpinTunes and listen to the other contest participants. There's a great collection of songwriters over there, and lots of good music to explore.\r\n\r\nTHE REVIEWS ARE IN!\r\n\r\n    \"doesn\u2019t really meet the \u2018sad\u2019 requirement of the challenge\"\r\n            -- Heather Zink\r\n\r\n    \"The challenge was not to write a funny song\"\r\n            -- Julia Sherred\r\n\r\n    \"instant DQ\"\r\n            -- Dr. Lindyke\r\n\r\n    \"I have NO idea who Brian is.\"\r\n            -- Joe \"Covenant\" Lamb",

Not necessarily all friction though. I mean, we really don't need the entropic soup that would result from lack of internal friction. No, just dry friction between solid objects (in case anyone really needs to get pedantic).",

While I do own a PS3 and a Wii, I just don't spend all that much time playing games anymore. When I did, my favorite franchises were Metroid, Castlevania, Zelda, and Mario, probably in that order. My first instinct was Samus from Metroid, but I couldn't convince my wife to sing the part. So then I reached back into my distant childhood and pulled out the really old stuff, from the dawn of video gaming itself: Pacman, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, TRON, Galaga, etc.\r\n\r\nAs luck would have it, I already happen to be sitting on a Pacman-related song idea. As luck would also have it, my song when written will be in the 3rd person, and as such is not appropriate for this 1st person challenge. The next option was Donkey Kong. I tossed it around a bit and came up with a few key \"what if\"s:\r\n\r\nWhat if Kong was actually pretty bright and educated, and liberally referenced Shakespeare and Greek classics, to the point of grating pretension?\r\nWhat if he still felt the pull of his inner ape instinct, and struggled against it?\r\nWhat if he wasn't really interested in the princess at all, but instead was attracted to Mario (then \"Jumpman\") and was just using her for bait?\r\nTaking the role of speculative fiction writer, I let flow with the \"what if\"s, and here we are. No matter how intelligent Kong is, I never could get over the fact that this plan is fundamentally flawed, and that he's doomed to failure (especially if Mario is straight, and really just wants the princess).

Show me what you've got.\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nI forget, is this my third or fourteenth gin?\r\nI don't sweat the weight I've always just been skin and bones without the skin.\r\nHey what's that pill you've been taking with your beer?\r\nLalalalalalala never mind, just pass one over here.\r\nBetween the famines, war, and crime,\r\nI burn out, the travel kicks my ass with boots of unpaid overtime.\r\nAll for some glorified naked chimpanzee.\r\nHey, no offense, but you people's deaths suck for me.\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\nI get it.

How many love songs out there are truly original? This is my take on a platonic man-love song. Some stalking, a bit of how we objectify celebrities, and a whole bunch of poking fun at the whole \"bromance\" thing, like we need a name for guys who are good friends. A lot of the other bromantic songs seem to bang on the gay aspect pretty directly, and I wasn't really with that, as either hinting at or denying a gay angle isn't what this song is about. It seemed appropriate to attempt a kind of drive-by lampshading and then let it go. Of course, that happens at the beginning of the chorus, so I hit the subjunctive 3 times. Too much?\r\n\r\nThe rhyme scheme is interesting in how it came about. I'm very much against the idea that a word rhymes with itself. Most of that is because it doesn't. And yet, I had \"me\" and \"me\" in the first verse in an AAXA BBXBB pattern. No problem, I'll just redefine the rhyme scheme to use AAXB CCXBB. Now the first and second \"me\"s are not rhyming with each other. One is an A, one is a B, and it's just a coincidence they're both in the same rhyming family. So there. I compensated by going the rest of the song (that is, choruses and bridge) without rhyming at all, a practice with which I'm becoming increasingly comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe music has some obvious influences: Elton John, Billy Joel, Ben Folds, Alicia Keys...basically anyone who uses a lot of piano in popular music. Also felt some Sondheim happening, but then I can't really play anything with a bunch of Imaj7 and IVmaj7 without hearing \"Pretty Women\". Bonus shout out to No More Kings' \"About Schroeder\" for the III7 to IV resolution. My instinct was to go to vi (treating the III7 as a V7/vi), but I liked the sound so I stole it.\r\n\r\nOuch. That \"different than\" really is big fat in there, isn't it? Bad Brian. Your an idiot, and you should of known better.",

I guess technically I could have written and recorded in two days, leaving the production work for the road, where I bring my laptop but not my recording equipment. But I'm so much more comfortable writing vertically. I'll write a verse, fully produce it, then move on to writing other verses. I'm to understand other songwriters do not typically work this way. So it made sense to try the whole thing in 2 days. Luckily one of them was a Sunday.\r\n\r\nMy letters turned out to be C, F, O, S, T, U, and W. I was on the edge of using G so as to have access to the phrase \"gooble gobble\", but it wasn't meant to be. In the end, W won the spot on strength of the phrase \"wailing wall\".\r\n\r\nAs for the song... you know how when you don't have kids, all your friends who have kids try to convince you to have kids? And then when you finally have them, you try to convince all your other childless friends to have some of their own? Yeah, sounds like some kind of freaky zombiesque cult to me too. I just hope no one else chose to write their song on the exact same topic. Boy would that be embarrassing.",

Founded Controlled Mayhem with some other kids at school, then joined the Pomona College Men's Blue & White in college, and was promptly exposed to the House Jacks at a West Coast CASA gathering. It was an eye opener, to say the least. They really got a full rock band sound out of just their bodies, and I was hooked. Due to funding (for equipment) difficulties, my college group never got mics and amps enough to do the really intense stuff. Later on joined a group in San Francisco and another in Florida. Nowadays, it can all be done in the computer, so it was time to try for a one-man attempt.\r\n\r\nEvery sound here originates from my body. The bass is doubled down an octave from what I sang and eq'ed to sound more like a real bass, because I'm a tenor. I added a little amp model here, a little chorusing there, echo, reverb... it's not what I could actually reproduce in person if there were 6 of me. Still, I'm happy this turned out so well. Had to do a lot of takes to get the intonation good enough, and almost said screw it I'll use Melodyne. For the record I'm not ethically anti-autotune; it's just another tool. But under a deadline like I was, it actually takes more time to do the editing than it does to do a dozen takes and comp together the best parts of each.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and modulating back and forth a major 6th (or minor 3rd if you prefer). Fun. It's what Jonathan Coulton does in the song from Artificial Heart: \"Tuscon Still Wants You To Dissolve, Sucker\". Allowed me to get a nice big range and mood change when the chorus comes in. I originally had it up a minor 3rd, but that wasn't dramatic enough, so I decided on going up the major 6th. My voice is still recovering.",

Burdens fall before the zenith of my climb.\r\nI think that it is finally time.\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\n[Verse 3]\r\nEver forward, though with love will come despair.\r\n.............................................Nothing left behind but gardens waning bare,\r\nHead shoreward to a land so bright and fair.\r\n.............................................And a footprint in a beach of hope and prayer.\r\nA star shining high leads us there.\r\n.............................................My unseen ally, lead us there.\r\n\r\n[Chorus]",

And romance was in the air,\r\nWhatever that is.\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\n[Bridge]\r\nYou and I were so insane, right up to the hurricane.\r\nA crush of fish, a cloud of bream,\r\nServed up a dish of scattered dreams.\r\nNo star to guide a way to find you.\r\n\r\n[Verse 3]\r\nSo I\u2019m back again. I do this every year.\r\nWhen I scan the crowd, and ask aloud if anybody saw you here\r\nAnd so it goes. This message in a bottlenose\r\nIs just a final filed appeal to fate. Now all I can do is wait\r\nFor the day when you will\r\n\r\n[Chorus]",

Not that I think Mr. Collins would have written it this way. He seems to take things head-on, where I tend to the unreliable narrator tack, embodying the person you're supposed to disagree with. Anyway, 24 hours later I had the song written, recorded, and produced. What a whirlwind.\r\n\r\nYou see, I'm supposed to write a seduction song, to put my \"lover in the mood\". It's the price for participating in SpinTunes 10. Whether or not this qualifies is out of my hands, but I think it does.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure I even want to say what all I meant with various parts of this. I think it's more the kind of song that should make a listener come up with their own ideas about the seductiveness of wealth, the kind of person this would put in the mood, 1st world guilt, whether it's ok not to consider the less fortunate for a while, etc. Or is it \"funny ha-ha\", like in a \"don't think about a green elephant\" kind of way?\r\n\r\nI will say that I intended to place a catchy, hummable melody over a harmony that gets uncomfortable in places. And that's all I have to say about that.",

                "about": "You know the cool thing about shadowing SpinTunes? I don't truly have to fulfill all of the challenge requirements. We're supposed to collaborate, but I'd really be dishonoring my previous song to take on a collaborator anyway, so here we are. Or to look at it another way, this is so heavily influenced by Harry Connick Jr. that it may as well have been a collaboration.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about and listening to funk a bit lately, and really wanted to write a song with some of those kinds of flavors. Now you may ask, if I'm going to dip my toes into a funky pool, why not model after some old school Sly, Clinton, etc. instead of a jazz man? Easy answer: I like the groove. It works for me.\r\n\r\nThis actually uses two pieces from my ideas list. The song idea itself is straight off the list, but I never had a musical theme in mind. So I cannibalized the chords from an idea I had for a sequel to \"Pi Day\" about how it's sad that pi day is over, called \"The Ides of March\". But I'm never going to write that one, so no big loss that I stole the chords (and about 1/3 of the melody ) for the verses in \"Off the Grid\". I don't even remember how I stumbled on this weird progression. Must have been melody driven because no one would start with these chords.\r\n\r\nIf I had more time, I would really have liked to vamp at the end, throw in some improv, create a busy groove, and sink into the funk some more before ending (probably in the same abrupt manner).\r\n\r\nOh, and multi-tracking! I've done this before -- notably on \"Descartes and I\" -- to create a smoother vocal, but I really leaned on it here. Three tracks for the main vocal, one much louder and the other two panned slightly left and right. Two lines each (L and R) for each of the two harmony lines, for 7 total. Then (and this was awesome), all I had to do was designate the main lead line as the \"groove track\" in Logic, slave all the others to it, and the software lined up most of the attacks, consonants, and note lengths. What would have taken hours of flex timing was almost instant. It's so easy I won't feel as daunted in the future about doing multiples of monophonic lines.\r\n\r\nLastly, I split an infinitive. On purpose. This isn't a \"different from/than\" thing like in \"Man Crush\" where I could easily have swapped out a word. This lyric really only worked as I wrote it, and I liked it enough that I'll somehow manage to live out the rest of my life in shame over what I've done.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's a song. Listen to it, cause otherwise it has no purpose.",

Finally realized I actually like it and should produce a legitimate recording, so here we are. Almost regretted the decision to do a Weird Al-esque recreation of the original production, as it's a monster. Swooshes, deep pulsing synths, kick drum with a very specific amount of beater noise, and that reversed guitar in the bridge.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it gave me the excuse to play all kinds of guitar parts. Some clean and precise (the intro), some sliding from fret to fret (start of the chorus), some just kind of dirty strumming and improvising over chords (later in the chorus). And all those other instruments were fun to pick out. There's even a piccolo in the second verse!\r\n\r\nI'm glad I decided to do this; it taught me a lot about how professional sound engineers get certain effects.",

                "about": "So you know how John Scalzi has musicians write songs for his books, as kind of a cross-promotional thing? Well that gave me the idea that I could do the same thing for Gene Ha's excellent new comic, Mae. We supported the Kickstarter and thus earned our early-release hardcover, so I had material to work with. \r\n\r\nTo catch you up -- in case you haven't read it, YET -- Mae's sister Abbie disappeared 8 years ago, when Mae was still a child. Now all of a sudden Abbie is back from -- it turns out -- another dimension, and she brought all kinds of baddies with her. Things happen, quests get accepted, and the two go back into the other dimension to... accomplish... something. Don't want to give too much away. I decided to write a song from Mae's point of view, exploring her emotions and relationship to her sister, who she hasn't seen for the better part of a decade. And in any event both are way different people now. \r\n\r\nLots of themes and motifs. Up front is the two-world thing, with Earth as we know it and this other unknown place full of monsters. To support this, I decided to go \"opposite\" in terms of keys, with the verse and chorus a diminished fifth (augmented 4th?) apart from each other. The transition from verse to chorus is smooth and led in by the melody. The returning transition is abrupt with a quick V7/bV --> bV (new I). \r\n\r\nThe book actually uses the phrase \"queen of oz\" in so many words more than once, so I ran with that. The title of course and many references from the Oz books and movie just seemed to work extremely well. Even one small reference to Wicked. Also, there's a lot of Slavic language and name stuff, specifically Czech. So you'll hear some of that influence as well. Principally a cimbalom -- a type of hammered dulcimer -- but also some violins for pads and a double bass to shore up the low end. \r\n\r\nWe're looking to push this in some manner when the 2nd season starts rolling out and the 1st season goes graphic novel format. For now, enjoy your early look just for being my fans :-)",

I intended to write about a guy winning an election to the position with the lowest possible amount of authority. Then gets drunk with power and feels he can be mean to everyone. What I ended up with was a guy who maybe pursued politics in the first place because of his low perceived position on the social ladder, and now that he's won thinks he's the shit. \r\n\r\nI really hope there's no one named Abernathy Fitzgerald who happens to hear this and take exception. I ran a web search and came up with some close names, but nothing exact. If I missed you, please know it was not intentional, and in any event that the narrator in this story is -- once again -- unreliable. Hmm, that seems to be a recurring theme around here. \r\n\r\nCan't decide if the bass line and groove remind me more of \"Express Yourself\" or \"Son of a Preacher Man\". Definitely more than a pinch of Dave Grusin in there too.",

                "about": "Oh my god so much learning I had to do for this one. First off the style is not one I've ever done before -- or even particularly listened to -- so there were many songs to study to figure out the feel and instruments. Many country songs with a bluegrass feel feature fiddles, and I considered it, but decided this one would use a slide dobro as the accent instrument. A distorted guitar on the left and a banjo rolling to the right fleshes out the mix, and I'm pretty happy with the sound. It required learning 2 new instruments, and I invite actual players of lap guitar and banjo to tell me where what I did was non-idiomatic or whatever. \r\n\r\nAnd of course what really made me realize this was going to be fun was the opportunity to do tight, monophonic harmonies on the chorus vocals. That's kind of my thing, when I can get away with it. The spoken prose for the verses? Well that was also a stretch, as I'd never done that before and was really unsure if I'd like how it turned out. Still haven't decided, but so far I'm pretty pleased. \r\n\r\nAs for the accent? Again, more study. I watched some YouTube videos and read sites that deconstruct the vowels and offer advice as to idioms and phrase construction. In the end, I'm quite positive anyone from Texas could spot me a mile away, but I was hoping if I did a really exceptional job then maybe some locals might just think I'm from a different part of the south. My wife happens to have been born in Texas, and she says it's not completely horrible. So I have that going for me, which is nice.",

How would the St. Crispin's Day speech have been different? Bam, done. Not really any other layers to spelunk here, pretty much just references to eating people, if versed in a pseudo-Shakespearean style. I guess I just always need to do _something_ to make writing lyrics a pain in the ass.\r\n\r\nI really had fun with the parallels to the speech, like where 'Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars, and say \"These wounds I had on Crispin's day.\"' becomes 'Then will he prove his spoils aheaped and thus proclaim \u201cThese cuts I reaped on St. Wendigo\u2019s Day.\"' You know, 'cause \"scars\" becomes \"cuts\", but here \"cuts\" means cuts of peeps meat. Too dark?\r\n\r\nThe _real_ fun though is in the music. It all starts with the tonic (coloured with maj7 and a 9th) moving to that ii\u00ba chord, which feels subdominant and introduces the flat 6. That opens up to the iv, also subdominant but this time resolving in a Plagal cadence right back to the tonic. Because I do this in the verse, I can change it up and use an augmented 6th in the chorus but expand it out to the dominant instead. Using the French version instead of German allows me to follow proper voice leading in the strings and avoid parallel 5ths. Take that, Beethoven. Thus there are 3 different forms of that flat 6 throughout the song, all doing different things. Me like. I even had a shot at a 4th different form by making the bVII in the pre-chorus a dominant 7th, but it sounded weaker and I needed the momentum rising to the chorus. Oh well.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this is my first time trying to hit that chorus downbeat on the dominant chord. Along with the orchestration I\u2019m hoping it gives the song a push forward, keeping it moving. We are after all marching toward a tasty, tasty battle.",

                "about": "This just in from the universe where \"them\" rhymes with \"from\"...\r\n\r\nAnother week, another songwriting challenge: \"Tell a story in song involving at least 3 people & have each person represented by a different instrument.\" The basic idea came to me only a couple days in, and yet with 2 days to go I found myself without a song. Maybe it had to do with the fact that I was on a very busy vacation full of music that was not this.\r\n\r\nBecause the song insisted on a double-length 1st verse, I ended up with 4 \"characters\", those being 4 of the personalities within me that make my life difficult. There are many more, but a song should only be so long. The instruments:\r\n\r\nMorning Me: piano\r\nDeadline Me: trumpets\r\nMortgage Me: organ\r\nPoser Me: cello\r\n\r\n...all acting as accents over a basic rock band. During the choruses I bring in the accent instruments I've introduced thus far in the song, so that as we move forward it gets busier and busier until it all cuts out at \"plain old Happy Me\". That's the basic idea.\r\n\r\nThe verses, including the 1-measure IV/IV part were quite solid in my head, which made it easier to write lyrics on the plane home. The chorus though was a pain in the ass that made no sense to me for a long time. I just couldn't hold the harmonies in my head, so I scribbled out chords and candidate melodies so many times and with so many different lengths that  no lyrics ever fit and I felt like I was going backwards (decomposing?). Finally I settled on a chromatically descending line where I knew where to start and where to end, and could at least fit lyrics. Then when I got home I was able to play and hear harmonies over the melody I'd already written and settle on the chords. Recording went thankfully very smoothly, and didn't require more than 4 takes for any 1 line. On a couple segments I was even good enough on the first take!\r\n\r\nStill, at midnight I called it and sent in a bounce before being truly satisfied with the work. What you have here is a revised version including more variations in the drums, slightly tweaked timings to line up doubling and harmonies, and I think a better mastering job.",

Good thing this is just sci-fi. \r\n\r\nKind of whiffed on the whole \"twelve\" thing. I imagined the aliens had 6 digits on their \"hands\" and counted in base 12. But then after writing the whole song I realized of course that we use base 10 and don't say \"tenty\". Getting past ninety-nine advances to a whole new word, and probably so would these aliens when they pass eleventy-eleven. And I can't change it now because it's part of a rhyme. So now, it seems the thing is that these aliens just really like the number 12. Or something else with a deeper meaning that I can take credit for. \r\n\r\nAlso, we have no idea how far they came from, because when they say \"light-year\", who knows how long a year is to them? Someone please do an analysis of all known exoplanets to determine which is closest to 120 light years away from the perspective of that planet's own orbital period. I'll be here, waiting.",

                "about": "Funny thing about yeast. You put out the proper nutrition \u2013 typically some kind of milled grain or fruit or really anything with stored carbohydrate energy mixed with water \u2013 and it literally shows up out of the air and does its thing for free. It eats the sugar and yields alcohol and carbon dioxide. That\u2019s if you\u2019re on Earth at least. If you\u2019re on your way to an alien world, there\u2019s no way to know if something else there does the same thing. Or worse yet, eats your food and yields toxins.\r\n\r\nSo our travelers have to bring their own yeast with them. To make matters trickier, dried yeast doesn\u2019t last much more than 4-6 months, and frozen not even that. So unlike plant seeds and more like animals, they need to keep the yeast alive by feeding it. Given the choice between baker\u2019s yeast, which gives off more CO2, and brewer\u2019s yeast, which favors alcohol production, the colonists chose the latter. Officially for ease of distillation for medical purposes, sterilizing things and what not.\r\n\r\nNow technically they could have brought both, keeping the baker\u2019s yeast alive in the form of sourdough starters that they feed regularly with fresh flour. But there was worry about cross contamination through the air, weakening the specific strengths of both while on board. The plan is when they reach their destination, to begin anew on breeding separate strains for specific purposes as was done on Earth a long time ago, their bread being just a touch less fluffy in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThis song felt like exactly the kind of thing that would be sung by folks convincing themselves that by getting drunk they are saving lives while improving morale, all tongue in cheek of course. I drew heavily on Helan G\u00e5r with the challenging-to-sing-fast middle section and the break in the lyrics to allow for drinking during the song (while slapping the table or stomping your feet). The music itself is as simple as possible so as to be easily learnable by anyone, but the lyrics get harder to do in step with your drinking more and more.",

Most of the story remains for now untold, but we fast forward to a time when a group of humans is colonizing another planet. Why and how they got there? That\u2019s another song (or 12).\r\n\r\nThe colony ship was seen as an ark, saving species, records, and anything they felt was necessary from Earth to support humans. Livestock, crops, scientific knowledge, etc. Anything non-essential was left in order to preserve space and weight quota for the important things.\r\n\r\n\u2026except that one boy smuggled onboard a sachet of kumquat seeds. Ascorbic acid was covered by the bell peppers and kale, citric by lemons and oranges. There was no need for these smallest of the citrus fruits, saved from extinction by the smallest human in the new colony.\r\n\r\nA filmmaker documents the construction of the new colony, with its neat rows of crops and habitats, creating a short, experimental film. A musician among the colonists scores it. Along the way they find the kumquat sapling surviving off to the side, outside of the plan.\r\n\r\nCritics disagree on the meaning of the film, and the makers refuse to explain, insisting, \u201cit is up [to] the viewer to take for himself/herself what it is that [the film] means.\u201d Some liken the current state of limited biological diversity as mere exaggeration of what was happening on Earth all this time, the kumquat tree signaling hope for something more. Others see a triumph of human ingenuity and dedication to overcome a literally world-ending series of events. For yet others, the kumquat tree is meant to show the importance of art and creativity in the midst of central planning to the finest detail. We\u2019ll probably never know the true intention.",

                "about": "Wow, this is pretty precisely the 10th anniversary of when I decided to try my hand at songwriting. I started with this attempt to write lyrics to someone else's music, specifically Jonathan Coulton's \"You Ruined Everything\". Been quite a ride. When I wrote this, my daughter was 8 and crazy about becoming an astronaut. She read the Space Shuttle Operator's Manual I got at Space Academy when I was a kid, and talked about being the first woman on Mars. So why not pick a song originally written by a father to his daughter?\r\n\r\nI heard this in my brain ear as a piano piece, and first learned to play it that way, but never could get it to sound quite like it did in my head. The first recording used programmed piano and drums on a brush set and sounded quite clunky, enough to find its way into my \"Also This Other Stuff\" album. Over time I performed it live on guitar (using JoCo's original playstyle), and finally ukulele, using a combination of fingerpicking and strumming. Now that I've actually found time to rerecord it, I didn't need to choose between the two. I settled on a \"dueling ukuleles\" style, with one doing a basic bass/strum on the on/off beats to create a bouncy feel, and the other doing fingerpicking reminiscent of the original. Add in a Mexican guitarron for a lower bass line with sustain that roughly matches the ukes, just a touch of shaker, and a string pad during the bridge, and I really like the sound of this.",

It could be anywhere.\r\n\r\nThere's no rush to know where you'll set down.\r\nYou'll find you've found your home when you get there.\r\n\r\nAll the while you run those rings around us,\r\nYou should smile, and orbit us aware\r\nThat we'll be the planet to your moon,\r\nThe gravity for the well we share.\r\n\r\nYour trajectory's chaotic, but we'll still be\r\nRight behind you when you get there.\r\n\r\nWatch out for asteroids there. Cyborgs and evil droids there.\r\nBlack holes and empty voids where you're alone.\r\nWhen solar winds get stormy, our fusion stays all warmy.\r\nCollect some stardust for me while exploring\r\n\r\nOn your own. Discovering it all,\r\nThe great unknown; know it if you dare.\r\n\r\nWe'll be hanging on your every word,\r\nSo tell us all about it when you get there.",
