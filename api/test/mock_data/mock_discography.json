                "about": "Music by Jonathan Coulton, lyrics by Brian Gray\r\n\r\nA companion piece to \"When You Get There\", I wrote this partly to ease my way into songwriting. It uses the music from Jonathan Coulton's \"I'm Your Moon\", and in fact, I ended up staying very close to the original orchestration. I intended to get the instruments in place, modeled after Coulton's piece, then one by one replace them with voice until the entire piece was rendered in contemporary a cappella style, complete with vocal percussion. I may still do that someday, but halfway through the effort I decided the version with instruments sounded better, so I put that on hold.\r\n\r\nAs for the song itself, the inspiration for its subject matter comes from a book my wife is currently writing, entitled \"Dream Girl\". Without giving too much away (not my plot to share), it renders dreams, prophesies, and loss on a canvas of adventure and horror, with appropriate touches of humor. I imagine this song playing over the closing credits of the movie made from the book.",

In my dreams, you change everything\r\nBlack and white to a rainbow of light that makes me sing.\r\nPromise me you'll still be by my side in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nProphesying on tiptoes omens of sin.\r\nOn a journey to Hypnos, but walking a line between the twins.\r\nWith your help I know I'll get there.\r\nTell the ferryman he can have his fare.\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\nWhere the real world shines\r\nTo show me truth behind the signs\r\nI dreamed.\r\n\r\n[Verse 3]\r\nFalling downward forever, dragged out to sea,\r\nMonsters, demons, whatever, I won't be afraid if you're with me.\r\nThe revelation is now complete.\r\nI drift unconscious ablaze for when we meet\r\n\r\n[Chorus]"

                "about": "The time has come once again for SpinTunes, and this time I'm entered as a contestant! The round 1 challenge was as follows:\r\n\r\nThere's No Place Like Home - Write a song about YOUR hometown.\r\n\r\nYou should use the name of the town in the song at some point. The town you pick can be your place of birth, where you grew up, or where you're living now; but it has to be someplace you have actually lived at some point in your life. If you once took a 2 week vacation to Florida...that does not count. We mean someplace you have roots of some sort.\r\n\r\nI've lived in South Bend, Indiana for the past three years now. It's a great place, nestled comfortably between \"small town\" and \"real city\". We get four seasons most years (seemed to skip Spring this time around), excellent family neighborhoods, and it's an easy drive or train ride to Chicago if we want to see a large-budget show or eat at a four-star restaurant.\r\n\r\nAs for the song, I expect the most frequently asked question will inevitably be \"what do you have against St. Louis?\" Perhaps I'll even get me an arch enemy out of the whole ordeal. The reality isn't so interesting. I actually think St. Louis is a beautiful place, and considered moving there at one point. Its two largest flaws are syllabic pattern and luck. To fit the song the way I wanted, I needed a city with three syllables, and the stress on the middle one. Candidate cities: Milwaukee, Miami, St. Louis, Toledo, Eureka, Ann Arbor. You may think of more, but my die has six sides so I stopped there. The roll came up \"3\", so St. Louis it is, despite that being by far the most difficult of the six to sing high.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of singing, this one was tough. Obviously influenced by \"We Are The World\", I took the composition job seriously and wrote for many diverse voices to sing it. That meant taking the pitch up and down quite a way to give a place for all voice types. As it turned out, the original melody exceeded my personal vocal range. It was well over 2 octaves all told, so in order to hit the higher harmonies, I couldn't get a good quality on the lowest notes. Given the options of recording up and transposing in software or changing the composition, I opted for the latter. I took the chorus down to a lower point, and transposed the whole piece up a minor third. It still clocks in at 2 octaves plus a half step, but I think it sounds better this way.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and first ever song produced entirely in Logic Pro! GarageBand has been good to me, but it's time to move on. Hope there are no bad feelings. For one thing, features aside Logic Pro is much easier on my bottom-of-the-line laptop processor. GB was complaining of lack of resources at 6-7 tracks. This song has 22 with all the vocal harmony and clapping and more layers of effects than I used to do. I also love the ability to bus primary tracks together to aux tracks, either via sends or output. I was able to balance all the drums individually with separate eq for the kick, an '80's-style gated reverb for the snare, and doubled hi-hat panned hard left and right, blend with the bass and claps, and adjust all that as one unit through my \"Rhythm Section\" aux channel. Really cool stuff.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have the nagging feeling that the melody that starts the choruses has been done before, but I can't place it. If anyone finds out I'm infringing on a prior work, please let me know and I'll change it. For some reason I'm thinking late '70's / early '80's ballad.",

A blessing lines the curse.\r\nWe've had our share of bumps and bruises, yet it could be worse.\r\nThe streets go mostly unpoliced. The jail's on fire, still at least\r\nWe're not St. Louis, but give us money.\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nThis Godzilla-looking thing, Godzilla we're assuming\r\nCrushed into metal, wood, and stones\r\nThe Chocolate Cafe, but not before consuming\r\nA whole big thing of Toblerones.\r\nThe Morris and The College Football Hall of Fame\r\nAre both destroyed, and the river set aflame.\r\nConsole the families of the students swallowed whole at Notre Dame\r\nBy reminding them\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nAt least we're not St. Louis. A blessing lines the curse.\r\nWe've had our share of bumps and bruises, yet it could be worse.\r\nWe've been trampled by a beast. Not much left standing, but at least\r\nWe're not St. Louis, but no, it's bad here.\r\n\r\n[Bridge]\r\n'Cause there are places on the Earth\r\nFull of misery and suffering.\r\nFrom Mogadishu to Detroit and Kandahar, for what it's worth,\r\nCome on and join us while we sing\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nAt least we're not St. Louis. A blessing lines the curse.\r\nWe've had our share of bumps and bruises, yet it could be worse.\r\nInsurance rates have all increased. The zoo's gone empty, but at least\r\nWe're not St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nAt least we're not St. Louis. A blessing lines the curse.\r\nWe've had our share of bumps and bruises, yet it could be worse.\r\nHalf the city's now deceased. Nothing grows here, but at least\r\nWe're not St. Louis, or Sacramento."
