    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\r\nDizzy, tumbling, fearful, adrift in space,\r\nStruggling to escape it, but most of my soul was trapped in place.\r\nThen you magically changed my world.\r\nEver since I've been flying with the girl\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nOf my dreams. In my dreams, you change everything\r\nBlack and white to a rainbow of light that makes me sing.\r\nPromise me you'll still be by my side in the morning.\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nProphesying on tiptoes omens of sin.\r\nOn a journey to Hypnos, but walking a line between the twins.\r\nWith your help I know I'll get there.\r\nTell the ferryman he can have his fare.\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\nWhere the real world shines\r\nTo show me truth behind the signs\r\nI dreamed.\r\n\r\n[Verse 3]\r\nFalling downward forever, dragged out to sea,\r\nMonsters, demons, whatever, I won't be afraid if you're with me.\r\nThe revelation is now complete.\r\nI drift unconscious ablaze for when we meet\r\n\r\n[Chorus]",

    "about": "Music by Jonathan Coulton, lyrics by Brian Gray\r\n\r\nA companion piece to \"When You Get There\", I wrote this partly to ease my way into songwriting. It uses the music from Jonathan Coulton's \"I'm Your Moon\", and in fact, I ended up staying very close to the original orchestration. I intended to get the instruments in place, modeled after Coulton's piece, then one by one replace them with voice until the entire piece was rendered in contemporary a cappella style, complete with vocal percussion. I may still do that someday, but halfway through the effort I decided the version with instruments sounded better, so I put that on hold.\r\n\r\nAs for the song itself, the inspiration for its subject matter comes from a book my wife is currently writing, entitled \"Dream Girl\". Without giving too much away (not my plot to share), it renders dreams, prophesies, and loss on a canvas of adventure and horror, with appropriate touches of humor. I imagine this song playing over the closing credits of the movie made from the book.",
